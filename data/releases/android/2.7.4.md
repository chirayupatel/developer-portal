There were updates made to the SDK including numerous features SDK additions, as well as bug fixes and deprecated methods that have been removed as they are no longer supported by the SDK.

## Addition of "com.flybits.intents.context" Broadcast when Context Plugin data changes

The main feature addition to the 2.7.4 version of the Android SDK is the ability to receive Context Plugin changes s intent broadcasts from the SDK within your application. In order to do so, the application must subscribe to the PushManager.BROADCAST_CONTEXT_INTENT broadcast intent as shown below:

```java
IntentFilter filter = new IntentFilter(PushManager.BROADCAST_CONTEXT_INTENT);
registerReceiver(receiver, filter);
```
where the receiver code can be seen below:

```java
BroadcastReceiver receiver = new BroadcastReceiver() {
  @Override
  public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {
    Bundle bundle = intent.getExtras();
    if (bundle.containsKey(PushManager.BROADCAST_CONTEXT_TYPE)) {

      //AvailablePlugins.BATTERY.getKey() can be any Context Plugin Identifier
      if (bundle.getString(PushManager.BROADCAST_CONTEXT_TYPE).equals(AvailablePlugins.BATTERY.getKey())) {

        BatteryData data = bundle.getParcelable(PushManager.BROADCAST_CONTEXT_OBJ);

        if (data != null) {
          //Do Something
        }
      }

      else if (bundle.getString(PushManager.BROADCAST_CONTEXT_TYPE).equals(AvailablePlugins.BEACON.getKey())) {

        BeaconActive data   = bundle.getParcelable(PushManager.BROADCAST_CONTEXT_OBJ);
        boolean isInRange   = bundle.getBoolean("inRange");

        if (data != null) {
            //Do Something
        }
      }
    }
  }
};
```
Of course, don't forget to unregister your receiver.

```java
unregisterReceiver(receiver);
```
